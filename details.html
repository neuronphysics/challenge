      <h2 class="section-heading text-center" style="font-family:Lobster;font-size:40px;">Chomsky's view on anti-semitism</h2>
      <p id="anti" style="font-size:20px;font-family:cursive;">In a 2004 Heeb Magazine interviewed Prof. Chomsky asking the following question:
      <br>
      <q>Let's return to anti-Semitism for a moment. You've written that you don't perceive anti-Semitism as a problem anymore, at least in this country, since its institutional applications and casual manifestations have basically disappeared. Do you still believe that?</q>
      <br>
      He replied: <q>I grew up with anti-Semitism in the United States. We were the only Jewish family in a mostly Irish- and German-Catholic neighborhood, which was very anti-Semitic and pretty pro-Nazi. For a young boy in the streets, you got to know what that meant. When my father was first able to get a secondhand car in the late 30s, we drove to the local mountains and passed hotels that said <i>restricted</i> meaning <i>no Jews</i>. That was just part of life. When I got to Harvard in the 1950s, the anti-Semitism was so thick you could cut it with a knife. In fact, one of the reasons MIT is a great university is that people like Norbert Wiener couldn't get jobs at Harvard—it was too anti-Semitic—so they came to the engineering school down the street. That was anti-Semitism. Now, it's a very marginal issue. There is still racism, but it's anti-Arab racism which is extreme. Distinguished Harvard professors write that Palestinians are people who bleed and breed their misery in order to drive the Jews into the sea, and that's considered acceptable. If some distinguished Harvard professor were to write that Jews are people who bleed and breed and advertise their misery in order to drive Palestinians into the desert, the cry of outrage would be enormous. When Jewish intellectuals who are regarded as humanist leaders say that Israel ought to settle the underpopulated Galilee—meaning too many Arabs, not enough Jews—that's considered wonderful. Violent anti-Arab racism is so prevalent that we don't even notice it. That's what we should be worried about. It's in the cinema, advertising, everywhere. On the other hand, anti-Semitism is there, but very marginal.</q></p>

      <h2 class="section-heading text-center" style="font-family:Lobster;font-size:40px;">Chomsky's view on freedom of speech</h2>
      <p id="anti" style="font-size:20px;font-family:cursive;"><q>For clarity, we should distinguish freedom of speech from freedom of the press. Thus even if freedom of press were a facade, freedom of speech would be worth defending and expanding. And I think it is a fact, and an important one, that by comparative measures the US has achieved high standards in protecting freedom of speech.<br>
      As for freedom of the press, while there is no doubt that the extreme concentration of economic-political power has an overwhelming influence on the mass media (and every other aspect of life), I would not want to call it “absolute control.” Even in a totalitarian state or military dictatorship or slave society, control is never absolute. In societies like ours, freedom of press is far from just a facade. There are many possibilities to pressure the media, and there are openings within them. There are also many other options beyond the mass media, some of which have been exploited very effectively.</q></p>
